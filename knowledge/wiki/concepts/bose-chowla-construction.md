# Bose–Chowla Sidon-set construction

## TL;DR

The **Bose–Chowla 1962** construction gives an explicit Sidon set (`B_2[1]` set, i.e., all pairwise differences distinct) of size `q+1` in `ℤ/(q²−1)` for any prime power `q`. It's the canonical algebraic Sidon construction in the additive-combinatorics toolkit. **For P19 specifically, Bose–Chowla cannot improve the SOTA** because Sidon sets distribute differences uniformly across `[1, q²−1]`, while P19 wants them clustered as a contiguous prefix `[1, c(A)]`. This is a fundamental mismatch — same reason Singer, Paley QR, and GMW also fail for P19.

## What it is

Construction (Bose–Chowla 1962, Comment. Math. Helv.):

1. Let `q` be a prime power. Work in `GF(q²)` with primitive element `θ`.
2. For each `a ∈ F_q`, compute `θ − a ∈ GF(q²)*` and take its discrete logarithm `log_θ(θ − a) ∈ ℤ/(q²−1)`.
3. The resulting `q+1` integers form a Sidon set in `ℤ/(q²−1)` (one element per `a ∈ F_q`, plus optionally `0` representing `log(∞)` in projective normalization).

Reproducer: `cb/scripts/difference_bases/bose_chowla.py`. For `q=89`, produces an 89-element Sidon set in `ℤ/7920` with `c(B) = 34`.

## When it applies

**Where Bose–Chowla shines:**

- **Construction of Sidon-set extremal lower bounds** — paired with the trivial counting bound `|B| ≤ q+1` for `B_2[1]` in `[1, q²]`, Bose–Chowla certifies the bound is tight.
- **B_h[g] generalization base case** — Vinuesa thesis ([domains/sci-math/source/2010-vinuesa-sidon-thesis.md](../domains/sci-math/source/2010-vinuesa-sidon-thesis.md)) builds B_h[g] constructions from Bose–Chowla seeds.
- **Cyclic difference families** — Bose–Chowla difference sets connect to perfect difference families on cyclic groups (see Buratti et al. 2025 framework).
- **Lattice constructions in dimensions `d ∣ q²−1`** — for example, `q=29` gives `q²−1 = 840`, which matches the empirical kissing-number cap κ(12) = 840 for P22's d=12 (open question whether this is coincidence or structural — see [questions/](../questions/) for the open seed).
- **B_2[g] sets for autoconvolution problems** — the Vinuesa machinery applies to P2/P3 autocorrelation lower-bound constructions when `g ≥ 2`.

**Where Bose–Chowla does NOT help:**

- **P19 difference bases / sparse rulers** — fundamental mismatch (see Limits below).
- **Spherical codes** (P11 Tammes) — wrong domain (continuous sphere, not modular integers).
- **Packing problems** (P14, P17, P18) — same.

## Why it works

The construction exploits the fact that `θ − a` (for `a ∈ F_q`) parameterizes a line in `GF(q²)` not passing through 0. The discrete-log image of this line is a Sidon set because:

If `log(θ − a) + log(θ − b) ≡ log(θ − c) + log(θ − d) (mod q² − 1)` then
`(θ − a)(θ − b) = (θ − c)(θ − d)` in `GF(q²)`,
which by quadratic uniqueness forces `{a, b} = {c, d}`.

The extra `+1` in `|B| = q+1` (vs `q` for some related constructions) comes from including the point at infinity in the projective normalization.

This is GAUSS-style algebraic construction: the Sidon-ness emerges from the multiplicative structure of finite fields, not from random search.

## Why it fails for P19 (the structural mismatch)

P19 wants an "atom" `A` with HIGH contiguous-prefix coverage `c(A)` — meaning every integer in `[1, c(A)]` appears as some pairwise difference. The SOTA atom has `|A| = 90`, `c(A) = 1043`.

Bose–Chowla gives a Sidon set: every difference appears AT MOST ONCE. So `|B-B|⁺ = |B|·(|B|−1)/2` distinct values, scattered throughout `[1, q²−1]`.

For `|B| = q + 1 ≈ 90`, `q ≈ 89`, modulus `q²−1 = 7920`:
- Number of distinct differences: `89·88/2 = 3916`
- Range these can occupy: `[1, 7920]`
- Density in the range: `3916 / 7920 ≈ 49%`
- Empirical contiguous prefix: `c(B) = 34` (computed for q=89, see reproducer)

To use Bose–Chowla as P19's atom in a Kronecker decomposition `B = A ⊕ λ·R`:

- Bridging requires `c(A) ≥ λ − max(A) − 1` (see [p19-kronecker-bridging-threshold.md](../findings/p19-kronecker-bridging-threshold.md))
- Bose–Chowla gives `c(A) ≈ 34`, `max(A) ≈ 7900`, so bridging requires `λ ≤ 7935`
- Score `= k² / (Lλ + c(A)) = 356² / (6·7935 + 34) = 2.660` — worse than SOTA 2.639

Even at `q=97` where `c(B) = 97` (largest tested), the score projection stays above 2.66 once bridging is enforced.

The structural reason: **Sidon's "all-distinct-diffs" property and P19's "contiguous-prefix-coverage" property are mutually antagonistic.** Sidon spreads coverage thin; P19 wants it concentrated.

This is the same reason all four classical algebraic Sidon families (Singer, Bose–Chowla, Paley QR, GMW) failed for P19 in the prior council dispatch. They were each built for the wrong target.

## Classic examples

- **Singer 1938**: Sidon-distinct-diffs in projective plane `PG(2, q)`. Predates Bose–Chowla; structurally similar but uses different geometry.
- **Bose–Chowla 1962**: the construction above. Standard benchmark.
- **Singer-difference-set generalizations** (Storer, Lehmer): connections to cyclic difference families.
- **Erdős–Turán 1941**: probabilistic *existence* of Sidon sets; complement to Bose–Chowla's *constructive* existence.

## How the agent should use it

When the council dispatches with category `additive_combinatorics` or a Sidon-related problem:

1. **Gauss persona** ([personas/gauss.md](../personas/gauss.md)) and **Erdős persona** ([personas/erdos.md](../personas/erdos.md)) both reach for Sidon constructions. Bose–Chowla is the canonical algebraic case; Erdős–Turán the probabilistic case.
2. Check whether the target problem's structure aligns:
   - "All differences distinct" → Bose–Chowla applies directly (P22/P23 lattice dimensions, B_2[g] generalizations)
   - "Differences contiguous from 1" → Bose–Chowla DOES NOT apply (P19 difference bases, sparse rulers)
3. Use the reproducer in `cb/scripts/difference_bases/bose_chowla.py` to construct the explicit set for your specific `q`.
4. For non-prime `q` (prime power extensions), the construction generalizes via `GF(p^n)` arithmetic; not implemented in the current reproducer.

## Limits

- **Constructive only** — gives a specific Sidon set, not all of them. The set is unique up to multiplication by units in `(ℤ/(q²−1))*`.
- **Modulus is `q²−1`, not arbitrary** — restricts which dimensions/sizes are accessible. For example, can't get a Bose–Chowla-style Sidon set of size 90 in `ℤ/N` for general `N`; only sizes `q+1` in moduli `q²−1`.
- **The wrong tool for sparse-ruler problems** (the P19 verdict above).
- **Doesn't generalize to general additive combinatorics extremals** without modification — `B_h[g]` for `h > 2` requires the Vinuesa thesis machinery, which builds on but goes beyond Bose–Chowla.

## Open question (cross-problem seed)

`q = 29` gives `q² − 1 = 840`, which exactly matches the empirical κ(12) = 840 kissing-number cap for P22 (d=12). Is this:

- (a) Coincidence — `840 = 8! / 48 = 23·5·7·... has many factorizations
- (b) Structural — a Bose–Chowla-style Sidon set in `ℤ/840` underlies the κ(12) = 840 construction (Coxeter–Todd `K_12` lattice has minimum vectors with very specific multiplicative structure)
- (c) Cross-pollination opportunity — apply Bose–Chowla difference-set machinery to construct or verify the d=12 kissing configuration
