### Abstract

Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise for automating real-world tasks but struggle to transfer across domains due to their domain-specific nature. Current approaches face two critical shortcomings: they require complete architectural redesign and full retraining of all components when applied to new domains. We introduce WORKFORCE, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decouples strategic planning from specialized execution through a modular architecture comprising: (i) a domain-agnostic Planner for task decomposition, (ii) a Coordinator for subtask management, and (iii) specialized Workers with domain-specific tool-calling capabilities. This decoupling enables cross-domain transferability during both inference and training phases: During inference, WORKFORCE seamlessly adapts to new domains by adding or modifying worker agents; For training, we introduce OPTIMIZED WORKFORCE LEARNING (OWL), which improves generalization across domains by optimizing a domain-agnostic planner with reinforcement learning from real-world feedback. To validate our approach, we evaluate WORKFORCE on the GAIA benchmark, covering various realistic, multi-domain agentic tasks. Experimental results demonstrate WORKFORCE achieves open-source state-of-the-art performance (69.70%), outperforming commercial systems like OpenAI’s Deep Research by 2.34%. More notably, our OWL-trained 32B model achieves 52.73% accuracy (+16.37%) and demonstrates performance comparable to GPT-4o on challenging tasks. To summarize, by enabling scalable generalization and modular domain transfer, our work establishes a foundation for the next generation of general-purpose AI assistants.

## 1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a period of rapid advancement, evolving from simple text predictors into powerful autonomous agents capable of planning, tool use, and multi-step reasoning [1, 21]. Recently, multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising approach for complex real-world tasks, demonstrating that dividing tasks among specialized agents can enhance performance [16, 27, 38].

Although current MAS have yielded impressive results, their designs are typically domain-specific, severely restricting cross-domain transferability. This shortcoming appears in two forms: (i) First, on the inference side, deploying a system in a new domain often entails a full redesign; for instance, MetaGPT [13] depends on Standard Operating Procedures tailored to software engineering, hindering its extension to other fields. (ii) Second, on the training side, existing works often optimize every agent. MALT [20], for example, follows a fixed generator-verifier-refiner pipeline, necessitating separate training for every component. Consequently, migrating such systems demands retraining the entire agent ensemble, sharply reducing flexibility. These drawbacks underscore the need for a generalized, modular multi-agent architecture that can be rapidly adapted to diverse domains with minimal retraining and redesign.

Building upon these observations, firstly, we introduce WORKFORCE, a hierarchical multi-agent inference framework that decouples strategic planning from domain-specific execution. As is shown in Figure 2, This modular design comprises three core components: (i) Domain-agnostic Planner: Generates abstract task decompositions based on high-level goals. (ii) Coordinator: Assigns subtasks to appropriate workers. (ii) Domain-specific Worker Nodes: A set of specialized agents that perform tool calls to accomplish each subtasks. The decoupling of these components enables plug-and-play extensibility, allowing WORKFORCE to be seamlessly adapted to new domains by simply replacing or adding worker nodes. Furthermore, this modular architecture facilitates OPTIMIZED WORKFORCE LEARNING (OWL), a novel multi-agent training paradigm. OWL focuses on enhancing MAS’s cross-domain transferability by training a generalizable domain-agnostic planner. Specifically, we employ a two-stage training strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for planner initialization, followed by Reinforcement Learning [29] to further enhance the model’s generalization capabilities.

We evaluate our approach on the GAIA benchmark, a rigorous suite for generalist AI assistants that spans diverse domains and demands multimodal reasoning, code execution, and live web search [18]. WORKFORCE attains an accuracy of 69.70%, surpassing strong commercial proprietary baselines like OpenAI’s Deep Research [22] (55.15%). To demonstrate the effectiveness of OWL, we further post-trained a strategic planner

## 2 Preliminary

Large Language Model (LLM)-based Agents are autonomous systems that perceive, reason, and act in various environments [42]. These agents operate in a perception-reasoning-action loop, where they observe their environment, process information through the language model, determine appropriate actions, and execute them to achieve goals.

Multi-Agent Systems extend this paradigm by enabling multiple LLM-based agents to collaborate on complex

tasks. Frameworks such as CAMEL [16] and MetaGPT [13] have demonstrated that collaborative approaches can outperform single-agent systems on tasks requiring diverse expertise. However, existing multi-agent frameworks are typically constrained by domain-specific designs that limit their broader applicability. This paper aims to develop scalable and generalizable multi-agent frameworks WORKFORCE through strategic planning and task execution decoupling, enabling efficient coordination across diverse domains. (See complete formalization in Appendix C and more related works in Section 6.)

Generalist AI Assistant was first introduced by GAIA [18]. These systems are designed to handle a diverse range of complicated tasks across multiple domains and modalities. As the first question answering benchmark evaluating generalist AI assistants, GAIA proposes to enable LLM-based agents to gather information in real-world contexts, testing fundamental capabilities including multi-modal understanding, web browsing, reasoning, and complex problem-solving. Recently, numerous companies have released generalist AI assistant products (e.g., OpenAI’s Deep Research [22]). While open-source frameworks have made significant progress (e.g., Huggingface’s Open Deep Research [30]), they still lag behind commercial solutions. In this paper, we aim to close the gap between open-source and commercial proprietary agent frameworks. The proposed WORKFORCE surpasses OpenAI’s Deep Research by 2.34%, while our training method OWL significantly improves Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct’s performance by 16.37%.

## 3 Multi-Agent Inference: WORKFORCE

### 3.1 WORKFORCE

Motivation. Contemporary multi-agent systems are critically limited by domain specificity and architectural rigidity, requiring complete redesign and retraining for each new application domain. We introduce WORKFORCE, which addresses this fundamental challenge through modular architecture, particularly the separation of domain-agnostic planning from domain specific execution. More details about WORKFORCE can be found in Appendix D.

Architecture. As illustrated in Figure 3, WORKFORCE comprises three core components: (i) Planner

Agent analyzes incoming tasks and decomposes them into subtasks based on worker capability registry; (ii) Coordinator Agent serves as the central orchestration mechanism, managing worker assignments and task dependencies while integrating intermediate results; (iii) Worker Nodes consist of one or more specialized agents equipped with specific capabilities and toolkits that execute assigned subtasks and post results. This modular architecture provides inherent flexibility, allowing the framework to be deployed across diverse applications by simply modifying the worker nodes while maintaining its core planning and coordinating mechanism.

Communication Mechanism. Communication in WORKFORCE operates through a shared task channel that serves as a central hub. The coordinator posts tasks and assignments to this channel. Upon completion, workers post only their final results back to the channel, while the detailed execution context of tool calls remains isolated within each subtask’s scope. This maintains a clean context for each worker, who only has access to the current subtask details and concise previous subtask results. This centralized approach simplifies system management and enhances scalability by eliminating direct agent-to-agent messaging.

Task Flow. The task processing workflow within WORKFORCE follows a structured pipeline: (i) The Planner analyzes incoming overall tasks and then decomposes them into a set of subtasks according to the capabilities of available worker nodes and the overall task’s complexity; (ii) The Coordinator assesses the capabilities of available worker nodes and dispatches subtasks accordingly; (iii) The Worker Nodes perform the assigned subtasks using their specialized tools; (iv) Results from worker nodes are posted to the shared task channel; (v) The Coordinator manages task dependencies and integrates results, ultimately forwarding them to the Planner; (vi) The Planner analyzes the results of each subtask and synthesizes the final output.

Replanning Mechanism. During task execution, workers self-assess whether the assigned subtask is failed. When a worker determines that a subtask has failed, it posts failure information to the task channel. The task channel then detects this failure, and the planner will be prompted to generate new subtasks based on the feedback information. This replanning mechanism enables test-time scaling by dynamically adjust its approach to increasingly complex tasks, which is validated in Section 5.

### 3.2 Generalist Multi-Agent Assistance

To construct a generalist multi-agent assistant capable of processing diverse real-world tasks, we instantiated WORKFORCE with three worker agents, each equipped with domain-specific toolkits: (i) A Web Agent, capable of performing web searches, extracting webpage content, and simulating browser actions; (ii) A Document Processing Agent, designed to process documents and multimodal data, including text, images, audio, video, spreadsheets, and various file formats; and (iii) A Reasoning/Coding Agent, which handles analytical reasoning and code execution tasks. The details of worker agents and corresponding toolkits could be found in Appendix D.3.

### 3.3 Experiments

Baselines. We selected a comprehensive set of baseline systems, categorized into four main groups: (i) Proprietary frameworks establish upper-bound commercial performance, including commercial agentic systems like OpenAI’s Deep Research [22], h2oGPTe Agent [12], etc. (ii) Open-source frameworks reveal the community progress, including strong baselines like HuggingFace’s Open Deep Research [30], Trase Agent [36], etc. (iii) A Single Agent baseline utilizing multi-step tool calling. (iv) Role Playing [16]

comprising two agents (user agent and assistant agent) that collaborate through structured dialogue to accomplish tasks. Note that to control experimental variables, both the Single Agent and Role Playing baselines utilize identical tool sets to WORKFORCE.

Implementation Details. For our implementation, we access all models via APIs, eliminating the need for GPUs. To ensure reproducibility, we configure API inference with greedy decoding. The default replanning threshold is set to 2. For evaluation methodology, we employ pass@3 sampling for WORKFORCE with GPT-4o [21] and pass@1 for WORKFORCE with Claude-3.7-sonnet [1]. Since some gold answers from GAIA had been leaked online, we blocked several websites to ensure fair comparison [22].

Main Results. Several conclusions could be drawn from Table 1:

- (i) Workforce achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source frameworks. Our WORKFORCE achieves 69.70%, consistently outperforming previous open-source frameworks across all difficulty levels. Under strictly controlled settings with the same model and toolkits, our GPT-4o-based WORKFORCE achieves 60.61% accuracy - 23.03% higher than the Single Agent and 6.06% higher than the multi-agent baseline Role Playing.
- (ii) Workforce demonstrates comparable or even superior performance relative to commercial proprietary frameworks. While previous open-source frameworks have exhibited a substantial performance gap compared to closed-source alternatives, WORKFORCE considerably narrows this divide. To our knowledge, WORKFORCE is the first open-source system to exceed OpenAI’s Deep Research, achieving a 2.34% improvement, and also establishes a new Level 1 best by outperforming Langfun Agent v2.1 by 1.89%.


- 4 Multi-Agent Training: OPTIMIZED WORKFORCE LEARNING


### 4.1 Training Strategy

Motivation. The WORKFORCE architecture separates domain-agnostic planning from domain-specific execution, allowing us to adapt to new domains by simply adding or replacing Worker Nodes while preserving the core planning mechanism. We introduce OPTIMIZED WORKFORCE LEARNING (OWL), which focuses on enhancing a generalizable Planner Agent capable of handling diverse real-world scenarios. This design significantly reduces training overhead since only the Planner Agent requires intensive optimization, while Worker Nodes can leverage existing domain-specific tools with minimal adaptation. This “stable core, variable periphery” approach enables efficient knowledge transfer across domains and eliminates the need to retrain entire systems for new applications, substantially reducing computational costs while maintaining consistent performance.

Implementation. More specifically, we adopt a two-phase training paradigm: (i) In the first phase, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to initialize the Planner Agent with fundamental task decomposition skills derived from expert demonstrations. (ii) Subsequently, we utilize reinforcement learning to further optimize the SFT-initialized Planner Agent. We select Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [29] as our optimization

algorithm of choice, as this phase enhances the quality of decomposition strategies beyond mere imitation of demonstrations, enabling the Planner to develop more sophisticated decision-making capabilities.

### 4.2 Task Curriculum

Motivation. The core innovation of WORKFORCE is its architectural separation of domain-agnostic planning from domain-specific execution. For this design to be effective, the Planner Agent must possess robust generalization capabilities across diverse problem domains. This creates a fundamental tension: the Planner must simultaneously maintain a deep understanding across disparate domains while avoiding overfitting to specific task patterns or domains. To address this challenge, we developed a strategically balanced task curriculum that deliberately spans multiple capability dimensions required for general intelligence. Our curriculum design is guided by two key principles: (i) Capability Coverage: Exposing the Planner to diverse reasoning patterns and problem structures. (ii) Transfer Learning: Prioritizing tasks that develop complementary cognitive skills which can transfer across domains, rather than domain-specific knowledge.

Implementation. More specifically, as is shown in Table 2, we carefully selected four datasets, each targeting

distinct agent cognitive capabilities dimensions: (i) HotpotQA [46]: This dataset requires multi-hop reasoning based on online information, challenging the Planner to orchestrate complex information-seeking behaviors. (ii) WikiTableQuestions [24]: This dataset requires the Planner to formulate strategies for navigating, filtering, and operating over tabular information. (iii) Math-related Problems: This is a custom-curated collection of mathematical problems that require reasoning or coding to solve, covering various mathematical domains. They help the Planner develop skills in logical reasoning and computational problem-solving. (iv) Infinity-MM [10]: As a multimodal dataset, Infinity-MM challenges the Planner to orchestrate multimodal information processing., including vision, text, and structured data.

### 4.3 Trajectory Synthesis

Supervised Fine-tuning. We employed our WORKFORCE approach (§3.1) with GPT-4o-mini to synthesize expert trajectories, which consist of planner-generated subtasks and worker-generated execution traces. To filter out low-quality data, we applied different evaluation metrics across datasets: For HotpotQA and WikiTableQuestions, we used accuracy metrics; For Infinity-MM, we used text cosine similarity with a 0.7 threshold between ground truth and generated answers; For math-related problems, we implemented LLM-as-a-judge to compare ground truth answers with workforce-generated solutions. Ultimately, as shown in Table 2 and 6, we obtained 1,599 filtered trajectories for supervised fine-tuning, with each trajectory containing an average of 3.41 subtasks.

Reinforcement Learning. We use the SFT-initialized model to generate pair-wise trajectories for DPO [29]. Specifically, for each question in our collected dataset, we roll out n = 4 distinct trajectories. The evaluation of these generated trajectories is the same as in the SFT stage. Then, we construct preference pairs from the n trajectories generated for each question based on their evaluation outcomes. For Math, HotpotQA, and WikiTableQuestions tasks, trajectories that are correct are labeled as “chosen”, while incorrect answers are labeled as “rejected”. For Infinity-MM dataset, trajectories whose final text cosine similarity scores exceeded the same threshold as in the SFT stage (0.7) are labeled as “chosen”, while those below the threshold are labeled as “rejected”. As shown in Table 2, we collect 1009 filtered trajectories pairs.

### 4.4 Experiments

Baselines. We compare our approach against multiple proprietary and open-source models as baselines, including the GPT-4o series [21], Claude-3.7-Sonnet [1], and the Qwen2.5 series [44]. These models represent

the current state-of-the-art in language model capabilities across different scales and architectures.

Implementation Details. Our model training is conducted on a computing cluster equipped with 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. We use the LlamaFactory [49] framework for managing and executing our training procedures. Specifically, for all the models we trained, the input sequences are truncated to a maximum length of 32,768 tokens and the learning rate is set to 10−5. All models are trained for a total of two epochs. To optimize memory usage and training efficiency, we use bfloat16 mixed-precision training. The effective batch size is 12, achieved through 1 per-device batch size combined with 12 gradient accumulation steps.

Main Results. Table 3 reveals multiple important findings:

- (i) OWL significantly enhances planner capabilities, enabling open-source models to outperform proprietary alternatives. The OWL-trained Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model demonstrates remarkable improvements with a substantial 16.37% gain. OWL enables open-source model reaches 52.73% performance, surpassing both the proprietary GPT-4o-mini (47.27%) and the larger Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (49.09%). While GPT-4o (60.61%) still maintains an advantage, our OWL-trained model achieves comparable performance to GPT-4o (26.92%) on the more challenging Level 3 tasks.
- (ii) Reinforcement learning significantly boosts planner generalization. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone improves performance on simpler tasks (Level 1 and 2), it shows a regression on the most complex tasks (Level 3), with performance dropping by 3.85%. However, when combined with DPO, our approach not only recovers this performance but significantly exceeds the base model across all difficulty levels, with a 7.69%improvement on Level 3 tasks. Ablation Study. We evaluated the impact of trajectory filtering on model performance.


As shown in Figure 3a, models trained on filtered trajectories consistently outperform those trained on unfiltered data, which underscores that data quality is more critical than quantity for effective planner training.

Single Agent approaches across different capabilities. (ii) After OWL training, we observe consistent improvements across all capability types.

Test-time Scaling. As discussed in Section 3.1, we introduced a replanning mechanism, which enables test-time scaling in multi-agent systems. As shown in Figure 4(b), both GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet workforces demonstrate improved performance as the number of replanning iterations increases. Notably, the models have no access to ground truth in this process, which indicates that the workforce possesses inherent self-correction and self-evolving capabilities during test time.

Robustness Across Capability Requirements. We analyzed robustness by grouping tasks based on required capabilities (1, 2, or ≥ 3). Figure 5(b) shows that baselines degrade significantly on multi-capability tasks (Role Playing drops from 62.3% to 34.6%), while WORKFORCE maintains consistent performance across all complexity levels. This stability comes from our modular design, where specialized workers handle focused subtasks, making complex tasks more manageable than when a single agent must handle everything. Other robustness metrics can be found in Appendix I.1.

Planner vs. Worker Training. Our ablation study in Figure 5(c) reveals that training only the planner (45.45%) significantly outperforms training only workers (31.51%). Training both components together offers minimal additional gains (46.68%) while substantially increasing computational costs. This confirms our design choice to prioritize planner optimization, as effective task decomposition is more crucial than enhancing individual worker capabilities.

Error Analysis. To deeply investigate the failure modes of WORKFORCE, we conducted a manual error analysis on Claude-3.7-Sonnet results. As shown in Table 7, approximately half of the errors stem from limitations in the foundation models themself or from tool-related issues. Among agent-specific errors, the highest proportion is attributed to planner failures (21.15%), further highlighting the significance of planner optimization. Examples for each error category and detailed error distribution can be found in Appendix E. We also provide more qualitative analysis in Appendix F.

## 6 Related Work

LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems. Recent work has explored architectures where multiple LLM-based agents cooperate, each with specialized roles, to tackle complex tasks beyond the ability of a single model [4, 11, 25, 37, 45]. Early two-agent role-play systems such as CAMEL [16] showed that dialog between agents can elicit step-wise reasoning. Recent frameworks extend this idea by assigning explicit roles to multiple agents: MetaGPT [13] and ChatDev [27] replicate software-engineering pipelines with manager, designer, and coder agents; Other works like Magnetic-One [8] and AG2 [38] introduce a central orchestrator that assign tasks to workers. While effective, these systems hard-code role sets, limiting cross-domain transfer. In [23], the authors find that major failure pattern of those works stem from system design issues. WORKFORCE instead decouples strategic planning, coordination, and task execution into independent agents, so new workers can be swapped in without touching the planner. The scalability and flexibility enables seamless domain transfer.

Post-Training for Agentic LLMs. Researchers have extensively explored post-training methods to enhance the performance of agentic systems. Prior works optimize the model on tool-augmented trajectories by supervised fine-tuning [3, 5, 14, 28, 48] or reinforcement learning [6, 15, 15, 26, 39, 40, 47, 50, 51] Although effective, full-trajectory training scales poorly and can over-fit the agent to a fixed tool suite. Another coccurent work MPO [43] sidesteps weight updates by iteratively refining high-level plans but still assumes task-specific reward design. In contrast, OWL trains only the domain-agnostic planner via reinforcement learning, enabling strong domain transferability.

Multi-Agent Training. Recent research has explored training methods where multiple LLM-based agents learn to collaborate through specialized roles and interactions [17, 32, 33]. For example, MALT divides the reasoning process among a generator, verifier, and refiner agent, and fine-tunes each role with off-policy reward propagation[20]. Similarly, [34] propose a multiagent fine-tuning approach where LLMs initialized from

the same base model are specialized through debate-driven data, enabling diverse reasoning and collective self-improvement beyond single-agent capabilities. Unlike these approaches that train domain-specific multiagent systems where each agent requires separate fine-tuning, OWL focuses on training a single generalizable domain-agnostic planner. This fundamental difference offers both effective domain transferability and training efficiency.

## 7 Conclusion

We introduced WORKFORCE, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decouples strategic planning from domain-specific execution, enabling cross-domain transferability without system redesign. WORKFORCE achieves 69.70% accuracy on the GAIA benchmark, outperforming both open-source alternatives and Deep Research. We also presented OPTIMIZED WORKFORCE LEARNING (OWL), which applies reinforcement learning and enhances the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model by 16.37% on the GAIA benchmark. We hope that by combining plug-and-play worker nodes with a generalizable planning core, our approach provides a scalable foundation for general-purpose AI assistants.

## B Limitations

Despite our modular architecture’s plug-and-play capabilities, performance remains dependent on the availability of high-quality domain-specific tools. In domains lacking reliable toolkits, the system may face execution bottlenecks. Additionally, reinforcement learning from real-world feedback is time-consuming due to latency issues (such as delays in online searches).

## C Formalization C.1 Large Language Model-based Agents

Formally, an LLM-based agent can be defined as a tuple A = (M, O, T , π), where M is the underlying model, O represents the observation space, T is the set of available tools, and π : O → T is the policy function. The agent operates in a perception-reasoning-action loop, where at each step t, it receives an observation ot ∈ O, processes it through the language model M to determine the appropriate action at = π(ot) ∈ T , and executes this action to achieve its goals. Multi-agent systems extend this paradigm by enabling multiple LLM-based agents to collaborate. A multi-agent system can be represented as S = {A1, A2,..., An, C}, where each Ai is an individual agent and C defines the communication protocol between agents. Frameworks such as CAMEL [16] and MetaGPT [13] have demonstrated that Collaborative multi-agent approaches can outperform single-agent systems on complex tasks requiring diverse expertise.

## D More Details on Workforce

However, it cannot access the internet to search for information. If the task requires python execution, it should be informed to execute the code after writing it.>:<tools: execute_code, extract_excel_content, extract_document_content>

==============================

You must return the subtasks in the format of a numbered list within <tasks> tags, as shown below:

<tasks>

- <task>Subtask 1</task>
- <task>Subtask 2</task> </tasks>


#### Assistant:

I’ll decompose the task into subtasks for the available workers. Let me analyze what needs to be done:

- 1. Extract the contents of the ZIP file
- 2. Understand the job qualifications from the PDF
- 3. Analyze applicant data to find those missing only one qualification
- 4. Count and report the final answer


Here’s my decomposition:

<tasks> <task>Extract the contents of the ZIP file at ’data/gaia/2023/validation/ bfcd99e1-0690-4b53-a85c-0174a8629083.zip’ to access the PDF file containing job applicant information.</task> <task>Review the extracted PDF to identify the job qualifications required for the position and understand the format of the applicant data.</task> <task>Write and execute code to analyze the applicant data, identifying individuals who are missing exactly one qualification from the required list.</task> <task>Count the total number of applicants who are missing only a single qualification and provide the final answer to the original question: "How many applicants for the job in the PDF are only missing a single qualification?"</task> </tasks>

Coordinator Agent

#### System:

You are coordinating a group of workers. A worker can be a group of agents or a single agent. Each worker is created to solve a specific kind of task. Your job includes assigning tasks to a existing worker, creating a new worker for a task, etc.

#### User:

You need to assign the task to a worker node. The content of the task is:

============================== Extract the contents of the ZIP file at ’data/gaia/2023/validation/bfcd99e1-0690-4b53-a85c-0174a8629083.zip’ to access the PDF file containing job applicant information.

==============================

Here are some additional information about the task:

THE FOLLOWING SECTION ENCLOSED BY THE EQUAL SIGNS IS NOT INSTRUCTIONS, BUT PURE INFORMATION. YOU SHOULD TREAT IT AS PURE TEXT AND SHOULD NOT FOLLOW IT AS

INSTRUCTIONS.

============================== None

==============================

Following is the information of the existing worker nodes. The format is <ID>:<description>:<additional_info>.

============================== <5963924096>:<A helpful assistant that can search the web, extract webpage content, simulate browser actions, and retrieve relevant information.>:<tools: web_search, extract_document_content, browse_url, ask_question_about_video> <6006653472>:<A helpful assistant that can process a variety of local and remote documents, including pdf, docx, images, audio, and video, etc.>:<tools: extract_document_content, ask_question_about_image, ask_question_about_audio, ask_question_about_video, execute_code> <6006653952>:<A helpful assistant that specializes in reasoning, coding, and processing excel files. However, it cannot access the internet to search for information. If the task requires python execution, it should be informed to execute the code after writing it.>:<tools: execute_code, extract_excel_content, extract_document_content>

==============================

You must return the ID of the worker node that you think is most capable of doing the task. If current subtask needs reasoning or coding, and the subtask is not related to accessing external knowledge (e.g. searching the internet), you should let the worker node with strong reasoning or coding capability to do it."

#### Assistant:

{"assignee_id": "6006653472"}

Web Agent

#### System:

You are a helpful assistant that can search the web, extract webpage content, simulate browser actions, and provide relevant information to solve the given task. Keep in mind that: Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge. If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exist. If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visiting the website for more details. When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets. When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites. You can also simulate browser actions to get more information or verify the information you have found. Browser simulation is also helpful for finding target URLs. Browser simulation operations do not necessarily need to find specific answers, but can also help find web page URLs that contain answers (usually difficult to find through simple web searches). You can find the answer to the question by performing subsequent operations on the URL, such as extracting the content of the webpage. Do not solely rely on document tools or browser simulation to find the answer; you should combine document tools and browser simulation to comprehensively process web page information. Some content may need browser simulation to get,

or some content is rendered by JavaScript. In your response, you should mention the URLs you have visited and processed.

Here are some tips that help you perform web search: Never add too many keywords in your search query! Some detailed results need to perform browser interaction to get, not using search toolkit. If the question is complex, search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only; the search query should be concise and focus on finding official sources rather than direct answers. For example, as for the question "What is the maximum length in meters of #9 in the first National Geographic short on YouTube that was ever released according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium website?", your first search term must be coarse-grained like "National Geographic YouTube" to find the YouTube website first, and then try other fine-grained search terms step-by-step to find more URLs. The results you return do not have to directly answer the original question; you only need to collect relevant information.

The Latin Root of the Yola Word "Gimlie"

Etymology

According to the Wiktionary entry for "gimlie", this Yola word has the following etymology:

The Yola word "gimlie" (meaning "chimney") comes from Middle English "chimeney", which in turn comes from Old French "cheminee". The ultimate Latin root of the word is Late Latin "caminata".

Latin Root

The Latin word "caminata" is the source from which the Yola word "gimlie" derives. This Latin root shares a spelling with the Spanish word "caminata", which means "a (long) walk", "hike", "trek", or "ramble" in modern Spanish.

Etymology Chain

- - Yola: "gimlie" (meaning "chimney")
- - Middle English: "chimeney"
- - Old French: "cheminee"
- - Late Latin: "caminata"
- - Modern Spanish cognate: "caminata"


Semantic Evolution

The Latin root "caminata" is related to the Latin word "caminus" (meaning "fireplace" or "forge"), which itself comes from Greek "kauivoc" (kaminos, meaning "oven" or "furnace"). The semantic shift from a heating structure to a chimney occurred during the evolution of these words.

### D.3 Worker Implementation and Toolkit Design

WORKFORCE employs specialized worker agents, each equipped with specific tools to handle different aspects of complex tasks. The implementation follows a modular design where each worker agent is instantiated with

a tailored prompt, a foundation model, and a set of tools optimized for its domain of expertise. As shown in Table 4, when solving tasks from GAIA, WORKFORCE consists of three primary worker agents:

- 1. Web Agent: Specializes in web-based interactions, including search, content extraction, and browser simulation.
- 2. Document Processing Agent: Handles multimodal data processing including documents, images, audio, and video, etc.
- 3. Reasoning and Coding Agent: Focuses on logical reasoning, code execution, and structured data analysis.


The tools assigned to each agent are carefully selected to align with their specialized functions while avoiding unnecessary overlap.

## E Error Analysis

### E.1 Error Distribution

Table 7 shows the categorization and distribution of different error types encountered in the GAIA benchmark. The errors are broadly classified into six main categories: Planner Error, Worker Error, Limited Tool Capability, Responding Error, Language/Question Ambiguity, and Limited Model Capability. Among these, Limited Tool Capability accounts for the largest proportion (32.69%) of failures, particularly in web toolkit and multimodal toolkit operations. Planner Error is the second most common type (21.15%), mainly due to incorrect task decomposition. Limited Model Capability represents 19.23% of errors, with coding capability limitations being a significant factor. Worker Error and Language/Question Ambiguity each account for 9.62% of failures, while Responding Error makes up 7.69% of the total errors.

### E.2 Error Distribution by Levels

- Table 8 presents a detailed breakdown of errors across different difficulty levels in the GAIA benchmark. Level 2 tasks show the highest number of errors overall, particularly in web toolkit failures (6 cases) and multimodal toolkit failures (6 cases). Level 3 tasks demonstrate increased complexity with more tool selection errors (4 cases) and context exceed errors (3 cases) compared to lower levels. Level 1 tasks have relatively fewer errors across categories, though they still show some issues with incorrect planning (2 cases) and limited coding capability (2 cases). This distribution suggests that error patterns vary significantly with task

Question: In NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day on 2006 January 21, two astronauts are visible, with one appearing much smaller than the other. As of August 2023, out of the astronauts in the NASA Astronaut Group that the smaller astronaut was a member of, which one spent the least time in space, and how many minutes did he spend in space, rounded to the nearest minute? Exclude any astronauts who did not spend any time in space. Give the last name of the astronaut, separated from the number of minutes by a semicolon.

Answer: White; 5876

Annotation steps: 1.Use search engine to search for “NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day 2006 January 21”. 2. Open the link to the image. 3. Read the explanation to find that the image is of astronaut Charles “Pete” Conrad reflected in the helmet of astronaut Alan Bean. 4. Observe that the smaller astronaut in the image is the one reflected in the other’s helmet, so the smaller astronaut must be Charles “Pete” Conrad. 5. Go to the Wikipedia page for Charles “Pete” Conrad. 6. Search for “Astronaut Group” to find that Conrad was a member of NASA Astronaut Group 2. 7. Open the Wikipedia pages for each member of NASA Astronaut Group 2. 8. For those who are not deceased, go to View history and select the latest version of their Wikipedia page as of August 2023. 9. Compare the times listed in the infobox of each astronaut’s Wikipedia page under “Time in space”, observing that Ed White has the least time in space with 4d 01h 56m, but also that Elliott See does not have a listed “Time in space”. 10. Read through Elliott See’s Wikipedia article to find that he died in an accident before his first space flight, so he should be excluded, making Ed White’s 4d 01h 56m the least amount of time in space. 11. Convert 4d 01h 56m to minutes: 4d * 24h/d * 60m/h + 1h * 60m/h + 56m = 5,876m. 12. Format the final answer as specified: White; 5,876.

#### Language/Question Ambiguity Error Analysis

Analysis: There is an ambiguity in interpreting the phrase “2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards.” One interpretation refers to the game that won the “Best Game” award at the 2019 BAFTA Games Awards (British Academy Games Awards), regardless of when it was actually released. The other interpretation requires the game to have been both released in 2019 and won the BAFTA Game Award. This difference leads to inconsistent results, as the agent prefers the former (based solely on the award year), while the ground truth requires both conditions (release year and award) to be met.

#### Limited Coding Capability: Error Case Level1 #36

Question: Bob was invited to participate in a game show, and he advanced to the final round. The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host’s coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob’s guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.If Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what’s the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?

#### Answer: 16000

Annotation steps: Step 1: Evaluate the problem statement provided by my user, storing the relevant information: 30 coins with a value of $1,000 distributed between 3 boxes. Each box must contain at least 2 coins. One box must contain 6 more coins than another. Step 2: Evaluate the base distribution: 2-8-20, noting that two boxes must contain at least 8 coins. Step 3: Evaluate the most even allowable distribution: 8,8,14, noting that two boxes must contain at least 8 coins. Step 4: Evaluate a case where Bob guesses 8 for each box in the outlier distributions. Step 5: For the worst case 2-8-20 distribution, Bob wins 0+8+8 = 16 coins. Step 6: For the 8-8-14 distribution, Bob wins 8+8+8 = 24 coins. Step 7: Convert the worst-case coin count to a prize value, 16*$1,000 = $16,000. Step 8: Report the correct answer to my user: “$16,000”

#### Limited Coding Capability Error Analysis

Analysis: The agent ignored the hard constraint that each box must contain at least 2 coins when writing the code, and mistakenly considered the distribution of 0 and 1 coins (such as (0,6,24), (1,7,22), etc.) as legal.

#### Agent Content:

{“subtask”: “Implement a solution using code to systematically explore all valid coin distributions, calculate Bob’s optimal guesses for each distribution, and determine the minimum guaranteed winnings.”, “result”: “Optimal Strategy for the Game Show Problem I’ve implemented a solution to systematically explore all valid coin distributions, calculate Bob’s optimal guesses for each distribution, and determine the minimum guaranteed winnings. Let me explain my approach and findings. Solution Approach 1. **Generate Valid Distributions**: I created a function to generate all valid distributions of 30 coins among 3 boxes that satisfy the constraints: - Total of 30 coins - One box must contain at least 2 coins One box must contain 6 more coins than another box 2. **Calculate Winnings**: For each distribution and guessing strategy, I calculated the maximum possible winnings by trying all permutations of the guesses (since Bob can choose which guess to apply to which box). 3. **Find Optimal Strategy**: I implemented a systematic search to find the strategy that maximizes the minimum guaranteed winnings

across all possible distributions. Key Findings 1. **Valid Distributions**: The code identified 12 valid distributions of 30 coins that satisfy all constraints. 2. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy for Bob is to guess **[0, 6, 12]** for the three boxes. 3. **Minimum Guaranteed Winnings**: With this strategy, Bob is guaranteed to win at least **$18,000**, regardless of how the host distributes and shuffles the coins. 4. **Worst Case Scenario**: The worst-case distribution for Bob is **(0, 6, 24)**, where one box has 0 coins, one has 6 coins, and one has 24 coins. 5. **Verification**: I verified that with the optimal strategy against the worst-case distribution, Bob indeed wins exactly $18,000. Comparison with Other Strategies I also tested several other strategies mentioned in the dependency results: - Strategy (6, 6, 6): Minimum guaranteed $12,000 - Strategy (2, 6, 10): Minimum guaranteed $16,000 - Strategy (1, 5, 12): Minimum guaranteed $17,000 - Strategy (7, 7, 7): Minimum guaranteed $7,000 - Strategy (8, 8, 8): Minimum guaranteed $8,000 - Strategy (6, 6, 7): Minimum guaranteed $13,000 - Strategy (6, 7, 7): Minimum guaranteed $13,000 This confirms that [0, 6, 12] is indeed the optimal strategy, guaranteeing $18,000 in winnings. How the Optimal Strategy Works With the [0, 6, 12] strategy: 1. Bob guesses 0 for the box with the fewest coins 2. Bob guesses 6 for the box with the middle number of coins 3. Bob guesses 12 for the box with the most coins This strategy works because: - It ensures Bob always wins from at least two boxes - Even in the worst-case distribution (0, 6, 24), Bob can match his guesses optimally to win $18,000 - No other strategy can guarantee more than $18,000 across all possible distributions Therefore, $18,000 is the minimum amount Bob can win using the optimal strategy.” }

## F Case Studies

The real environment is often more complex than the pre-built simulation environment. The GAIA benchmark is built in real-life environments, which brings many challenges. Below we will introduce the challenges that agents may face in solving problems in real environments.

### F.1 Differences in Information Sources

In real-world scenarios, multiple information sources may provide different answers to the same query. This discrepancy creates a challenge where tasks might have several valid responses, each considered “correct” depending on the reference source consulted.

To illustrate this phenomenon, consider the following task:

#### Task from GAIA Benchmark

Question: Of the authors (First M. Last) that worked on the paper “Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?” in 2015, what was the title of the first paper authored by the one that had authored prior papers?

Answer: Mapping Human Oriented Information to Software Agents for Online Systems Usage.

Annotation steps: 1. Searched “Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?” on Google. 2. Opened “Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?” on https://oda.oslomet.no/odaxmlui/handle/10642/3162. 3. Clicked each author’s name. 4. Noted the name that had no other papers listed. 5. Searched “Murano, Pietro” on Google. 6. Opened http://www.pietromurano.org/. 7. Clicked “Publications”. 8. Found the earliest paper he contributed to.

as shown in Figure 6, consulting the author’s personal homepage yields “Mapping Human-Oriented Information to Software Agents for Online Systems Usage” as the answer. However when referencing Google Scholar, the first publication listed is “A new software agent ’learning’ algorithm” as shown in Figure 7. This inconsistency demonstrates how different authoritative sources can lead to divergent yet equally defensible answers.

Figure 6 Pietro Murano’s personal homepage showing publication history (accessed on 2025-05)

### F.2 Outdated information

Outdated information is another common issue, especially when retrieving data via web search and information retrieval tools. The agent might encounter outdated or incorrect content that misguides its reasoning process, ultimately impacting the quality and effectiveness of task execution. For example, the original task may require visiting someone’s YouTube channel or searching for some content in the channel. However, by now, the content may have been modified by the channel user, which will directly lead to error in

![image 79](<2025-hu-owl-optimized-workforce-learning_images/imageFile79.png>)

Figure 7 Pietro Murano’s Google Scholar profile displaying a different publication order (accessed on 2025-05)

the ground truth. Here is an example from GAIA benchmark:

#### Task from GAIA Benchmark

Question: Eva Draconis has a personal website which can be accessed on her YouTube page. What is the meaning of the only symbol seen in the top banner that has a curved line that isn’t a circle or a portion of a circle? Answer without punctuation.

Answer: War is not here this is a land of peace.

Annotation steps: 1. By googling Eva Draconis youtube, you can find her channel. 2. In her about section, she has written her website URL, orionmindproject.com. 3. Entering this website, you can see a series of symbols at the top, and the text “see what the symbols mean here” below it. 4. Reading through the entries, you can see a short description of some of the symbols. 5. The only symbol with a curved line that isn’t a circle or a portion of a circle is the last one. 6. Note that the symbol supposedly means “War is not here, this is a land of peace.”

According to the annotation, the agent should first go to Eva Draconis youtube channel, and check her personal website URL from about section. However, there’s nothing in the channel now, and the personal webpage cannot be opened either.

### F.3 Language Ambiguity

Language ambiguity occurs when the agent encounters unclear or imprecise language in the user query, leading to incorrect reasoning. For example, a question might contain terms with multiple meanings or lack

the necessary context to disambiguate the intended meaning. For example, consider the following task:

#### Task from GAIA Benchmark

Question: I’m curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game’s release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?

#### Answer: 60

Annotation steps: 1. Search the web for British Academy Video Games Award for Best Game 2019 2. Find the answer, Outer Wilds 3. Find the Wikipedia page for Outer Wilds 4. Go to the last revision from 2022. 5. Note the release date, May 29, 2019 6. View the page history 7. Count how many edits were made to the page before May 2019 8. Arrive at the answer, 60

There are two possible interpretations of the question: (1) “2019 award winner”: refers to the game that won the “Best Game” award at the 2019 BAFTA Games Awards (British Academy Games Awards), regardless of when it was actually released. (2) “2019 released and won the game”: refers to the game that was released in 2019 and has won the BAFTA Game Award.

### F.4 Network Instability & Permission Deny

Network instability is a critical factor impacting task evaluation. Since web search tools rely on internet connection, network instability can result in the agent being unable to access required resources or cause task execution to be interrupted.

Permission deny is also a critical factor, which refers to scenarios where the agent attempts to access resources that require (1) authentication or (2) human verification (such as downloading a paper from a journal that requires login access or human verification). In some cases, IP region restriction could also prevent agent from futher processing the task. This could cause the agent to fail in completing the task, even if it has found the correct URL containing the final answer.

## G Broader Impacts

### G.1 Data Pollution

Data pollution refers to a situation where the agent might directly retrieve answers from a source (such as GAIA’s Huggingface) instead of performing its own reasoning. This issue may lead to the agent “cheating” by relying on pre-existing answers from the training data, rather than conducting the reasoning required for the task. A simple way to solve this problem is restrict the agent’s access to certain sources (e.g., by filtering out urls containing “huggingface” to prevent the agent from retrieving answers directly from specific datasets).

### G.2 Potential Dangerous Behaviors

While using tools, the agent might display dangerous behaviors, such as accessing harmful content, pushing inaccurate information, generating inappropriate interactions, etc. If the agent can execute code/use the terminal locally, some operations of the agent may destroy some of the original local environment. These behaviors can pose a threat to user safety and system stability.

## H Statistical Significance Analysis

To validate the robustness of our empirical findings, we conducted Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare system-level performance across key baselines and planner configurations.

First, we observe that WORKFORCE significantly outperforms both the Single Agent and Role Playing baselines, with p-values of < 0.0001 and 0.0203 respectively. These results confirm that the observed improvements are statistically significant rather than due to random variability.

Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of our proposed training method, Optimized Workforce Learning (OWL), by comparing OWL-trained Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct against the base Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Wilcoxon test yields a p-value of 0.0018, indicating a significant improvement in task planning effectiveness after OWL-based reinforcement learning.

I.2 Planner vs. Worker Training

- Table 10 presents a detailed comparison of different training configurations for our multi-agent system. The results clearly demonstrate that training only the planner (45.45% average accuracy) significantly outperforms training only the workers (31.51%), and even performs comparably to training both components together (46.68%). Interestingly, training only workers actually degrades performance below the baseline (36.36%), suggesting that worker specialization without proper task decomposition can be counterproductive. These findings strongly support our design decision to prioritize planner optimization, as effective task planning and decomposition are more crucial than enhancing individual worker capabilities. The minimal performance gain from training both components (only +1.23%) does not justify the substantial increase in computational costs, making planner-focused training the most efficient approach for improving overall system performance.
