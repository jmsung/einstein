"""research_synthesis.shadow — wire pre-cycle synthesis to meta_loop's A/B harness.

Goal 6 of `js/feat/research-synthesis`. The shadow primitive (worktree fork +
arm metrics + delta + log) is `src/einstein/meta_loop/shadow.py` (merged via
PR #104). This module is the first consumer:

- A `rule_edit` Proposal that flips on the pre-cycle synthesis step at
  cycle-start in `.claude/rules/cycle-discipline.md`.
- A citation-aware promotion gate: A wins iff
  `findings_delta >= 0` AND at least one cycle in arm A declared
  ``cited_sources != []`` (the citation-grounded improvement requirement
  from the branch G6 plan).
- A metric extractor that pulls citation counts from the cycle-log's
  trailing `cites_src` column (the column my G4 added).

Caller is `scripts/research_synthesis_shadow.py`; tests live alongside.

    Goal 9 of js/feat/research-synthesis: the original `cycles_with_citations`
    reads the arm cycle-log markdown — but `run_shadow(cleanup=True)` deletes
    the arm worktrees before the orchestrator gets a chance to read them, so
    that path always returns 0. This helper reads the SHARED sidecar JSONL
    instead, filtered by the per-record ``arm`` tag that
    ``inner_agent_output.append_citation_record`` now writes when
    ``EINSTEIN_SHADOW_ARM`` is set.

    Args:
        sidecar_path: ``mb/logs/cited-sources.jsonl``.
        arm: ``"A"`` or ``"B"`` — the per-arm tag to match.
        since_ts: optional ISO-8601 timestamp lower bound (records strictly
            after this time count). Pass the run's start ts to scope to one
            shadow run when the sidecar has cross-run history.

    Returns:
        Count of records with ``arm == <arm>`` (and ts > since_ts if set)

+0a. **Pre-cycle synthesis (research_synthesis):** before step 0 (qmd query),
+    run `cb/scripts/research_synthesis.py --problem-id N` which writes
+    `mb/problems/<id>-<slug>/literature-synthesis-<date>.md` for the

+
 Every problem-attempt cycle MUST produce one row in `docs/agent/cycle-log.md`. Failures count. Cherry-picking is forbidden.

 **Why:** The whole `docs/agent/` layer — `cycle-log.md`, `skill-library.md`, `metrics.md`, `ablations/` — measures whether the agent actually self-improves. Without strict 1:1 cycle:log discipline, the metric becomes "best-of-N selected log" which is theatrically self-improving without being actually so. Honesty over optics.
